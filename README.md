hello!! to make this work you have to make a .env file it's contents should be like this:

CLIENT_ID="f234d141f9494c6583b4b051c786a9f9"     
CLIENT_SECRET="0e5901e6a1db4549b670c33ae62f9162"
REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3500/"
PLAYLIST_ID="your spotify playlist id"

note: you can change the client_id, client_secret and redirect_uri to whatever your client credintals are, if you wanna keep it as is keep it if u wanna put ur own app's secret and id and uri then that's fine too
