hello!! to make this work you have to make a .env file it's contents should be like this:

CLIENT_ID="your client id"
CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret"
REDIRECT_URI="your redirect uri"
PLAYLIST_ID="your spotify playlist id"

you'll need to run 'pip install ytmusicapi' in the terminal to install the yt music api that i use here
after that u simply run 'ytmusicapi oauth' and it should creat a 'oauth.json' file
